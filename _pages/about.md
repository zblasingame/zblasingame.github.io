I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Clarkson University](https://www.clarkson.edu/) studying reversible schemes for diffusion models.
My research interests are in generative modeling, and more specifically in numerical methods for neural differential equations, flow matching, diffusion models, and ai4science applications.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Clarkson University in 2025 supervised by Dr. [Chen Liu](https://camel.clarkson.edu/members.html).
During my Ph.D. I focused on controllable generation with flow/diffusion models along with downstream applications in biometrics.


*All of Christ, for all of life.*

In my free time I participate in amateur athletics as an opposite hitter for the [Clarkson Men's Club Volleyball](https://www.instagram.com/clarksonmvb/) team.
I also love any form of barbell training and I am currently working on joining the 1250 lbs club `[1145/1250]`.
