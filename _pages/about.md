I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Clarkson University](https://www.clarkson.edu/) studying guided generation and latent representations of generative models.
Lately, I've been interested in stochastic processes, generative flows, score-based generative models, and numerical ODE/SDE solvers.
Recent research has focused on bespoke ODE/SDE solvers for the gradients of diffusion models, greedy algorithms for guided generation, and guided generation for attacking Face Recognition (FR) systems.
I work in the [CAMEL](https://camel.clarkson.edu/) group and I am advised by Dr. [Chen Liu](https://camel.clarkson.edu/members.html).
Previously, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Clarkson University in 2018.

*All of Christ, for all of life.*

In my free time I am an opposite hitter for the [Clarkson Men's Club Volleyball](https://www.instagram.com/clarksonmvb/) team.
I also enjoy powerlifting and resistance training.

**I am currently looking for research positions in industry/academia in generative modeling. Particularly in diffusion models or generative flows.**
