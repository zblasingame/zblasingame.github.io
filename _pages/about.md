<!--I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Clarkson University](https://www.clarkson.edu/) studying reversible schemes for diffusion models.-->
In January I am joining [Aithyra](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/aithyra) in Vienna, Austria as a postdoctoral fellow under [Alex Tong](https://www.alextong.net/) where I will be on working on generative models for life sciences.
My research interests are in generative modeling, and more specifically in numerical methods for neural differential equations, flow matching, diffusion models, and ai4science applications.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Clarkson University in 2025 supervised by [Chen Liu](https://camel.clarkson.edu/members.html).
During my Ph.D. I focused on controllable generation with flow/diffusion models along with downstream applications in biometrics.
Examples include developing reversible numerical schemes for diffusion SDEs, numerical schemes for computing the gradients through the ODE/SDE solve of diffusion models, and developing face morphing methods with diffusion models.

In my free time I am an amateur athlete and theologian.
During my Ph.D. I was a `[middle blocker|opposite hitter]` for the [Clarkson Men's Club Volleyball](https://www.instagram.com/clarksonmvb/) team.
I also love any form of barbell training and I am currently working on joining the 1250 lbs club `[1145/1250]`.
