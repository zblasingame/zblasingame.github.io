I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Clarkson University](https://www.clarkson.edu/) studying inference-time control of flow/diffusion models.
Lately, I've been interested in neural differential equations, score-based generative models, rough path theory for ML, and applications in ai4science.
Recent research has focused on bespoke ODE/SDE solvers for the gradients of diffusion models, greedy algorithms for guided generation, and reversible solvers for diffusion models.
Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Clarkson University in 2025 supervised by Dr. [Chen Liu](https://camel.clarkson.edu/members.html).

*All of Christ, for all of life.*

In my free time I am an opposite hitter for the [Clarkson Men's Club Volleyball](https://www.instagram.com/clarksonmvb/) team.
Additionally, I enjoy any form of barbell training and other power sports.
