Presented three of our papers @ [IJCB 2024](https://ijcb2024.ieee-biometrics.org/).

* [Greedy-DiM: Greedy Algorithms for Unreasonably Effective Face Morphs](https://zblasingame.github.io/Greedy-DiM/) (*Main Conference*): A novel face morphing algorith with extends [DiM](https://zblasingame.github.io/DiM/) via a greedy strategy to increase the effectivness of face morphing. Achieves SOTA results beating all pre-existing methods.


* [Leveraging Diffusion For Strong and High Quality Face Morphing Attacks (DiM)](https://zblasingame.github.io/DiM/) (*Journal Presentation - IEEE TBIOM*): The first work to propose face morphing with diffusion models. Outperforms GAN-based models on the morphing task.


* [The Impact of Print-Scanning in Heterogeneous Morph Evaluation Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06559) (*Special Session*): A study on the impact the print-and-scan process has on the vulnerability of FR systems to face morphing attacks.
