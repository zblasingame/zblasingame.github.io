    abstract = {Matching unfamiliar faces is known to be difficult, and this can give an opportunity to those engaged in identity fraud. Here we examine a relatively new form of fraud, the use of photo-ID containing a graphical morph between two faces. Such a document may look sufficiently like two people to serve as ID for both. We present two experiments with human viewers, and a third with a smartphone face recognition system. In Experiment 1, viewers were asked to match pairs of faces, without being warned that one of the pair could be a morph. They very commonly accepted a morphed face as a match. However, in Experiment 2, following very short training on morph detection, their acceptance rate fell considerably. Nevertheless, there remained large individual differences in people’s ability to detect a morph. In Experiment 3 we show that a smartphone makes errors at a similar rate to ‘trained’ human viewers—i.e. accepting a small number of morphs as genuine ID. We discuss these results in reference to the use of face photos for security.},

abstract="In this paper, we propose a new descriptor for texture classification that is robust to image blurring. The descriptor utilizes phase information computed locally in a window for every image position. The phases of the four low-frequency coefficients are decorrelated and uniformly quantized in an eight-dimensional space. A histogram of the resulting code words is created and used as a feature in texture classification. Ideally, the low-frequency phase components are shown to be invariant to centrally symmetric blur. Although this ideal invariance is not completely achieved due to the finite window size, the method is still highly insensitive to blur. Because only phase information is used, the method is also invariant to uniform illumination changes. According to our experiments, the classification accuracy of blurred texture images is much higher with the new method than with the well-known LBP or Gabor filter bank methods. Interestingly, it is also slightly better for textures that are not blurred.",

abstract = {The vulnerability of face, fingerprint and iris recognition systems to attacks based on morphed biometric samples has been established in the recent past. However, so far a reliable detection of morphed biometric samples has remained an unsolved research challenge. In this work, we propose the first multi-algorithm fusion approach to detect morphed facial images. The FRGCv2 face database is used to create a set of 4,808 morphed and 2,210 bona fide face images which are divided into a training and test set. From a single cropped facial image features are extracted using four types of complementary feature extraction algorithms, including texture descriptors, keypoint extractors, gradient estimators and a deep learning-based method. By performing a score-level fusion of comparison scores obtained by four different types of feature extractors, a detection equal error rate (D-EER) of 2.8% is achieved. Compared to the best single algorithm approach achieving a D-EER of 5.5%, the D-EER of the proposed multi-algorithm fusion system is al- most twice as low, confirming the soundness of the presented approach.},

abstract="Identification by biometric features has become more popular in the last decade. High quality video and fingerprint sensors have become less expensive and are nowadays standard components in many mobile devices. Thus, many devices can be unlocked via fingerprint or face verification. The state of the art accuracy of biometric facial recognition systems prompted even systems that need high security standards like border control at airports to rely on biometric systems. While most biometric facial recognition systems perform quite accurate under a controlled environment, they can easily be tricked by morphing attacks. The concept of a morphing attack is to create a synthetic face image that contains characteristics of two different individuals and to use this image on a document or as reference image in a database. Using this image for authentication, a biometric facial recognition system accepts both individuals. In this paper, we propose a morphing attack detection approach based on convolutional neural networks. We present an automatic morphing pipeline to generate morphing attacks, train neural networks based on this data and analyze their accuracy. The accuracy of different well-known network architectures are compared and the advantage of using pretrained networks compared to networks learned from scratch is studied.",

abstract = {Learning a measure of similarity between pairs of objects is an important generic problem in machine learning. It is particularly useful in large scale applications like searching for an image that is similar to a given image or finding videos that are relevant to a given video. In these tasks, users look for objects that are not only visually similar but also semantically related to a given object. Unfortunately, the approaches that exist today for learning such semantic similarity do not scale to large data sets. This is both because typically their CPU and storage requirements grow quadratically with the sample size, and because many methods impose complex positivity constraints on the space of learned similarity functions.The current paper presents OASIS, an Online Algorithm for Scalable Image Similarity learning that learns a bilinear similarity measure over sparse representations. OASIS is an online dual approach using the passive-aggressive family of learning algorithms with a large margin criterion and an efficient hinge loss cost. Our experiments show that OASIS is both fast and accurate at a wide range of scales: for a data set with thousands of images, it achieves better results than existing state-of-the-art methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. For large, web scale, data sets, OASIS can be trained on more than two million images from 150K text queries within 3 days on a single CPU. On this large scale data set, human evaluations showed that 35% of the ten nearest neighbors of a given test image, as found by OASIS, were semantically relevant to that image. This suggests that query independent similarity could be accurately learned even for large scale data sets that could not be handled before.},

Dlib-ml is an open source library, targeted at both engineers and research scientists, which aims to provide a similarly rich environment for developing machine learning software in the C++ language. Towards this end, dlib-ml contains an extensible linear algebra toolkit with built in BLAS support. It also houses implementations of algorithms for performing inference in Bayesian networks and kernel-based methods for classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and feature ranking. To enable easy use of these tools, the entire library has been developed with contract programming, which provides complete and precise documentation as well as powerful debugging tools.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of diverse methods for performing image editing by employing pre-trained unconditional generators. Applying these methods on real images, however, remains a challenge, as it necessarily requires the inversion of the images into their latent space. To successfully invert a real image, one needs to find a latent code that reconstructs the input image accurately, and more importantly, allows for its meaningful manipulation. In this paper, we carefully study the latent space of StyleGAN, the state-of-the-art unconditional generator. We identify and analyze the existence of a distortion-editability tradeoff and a distortion-perception tradeoff within the StyleGAN latent space. We then suggest two principles for designing encoders in a manner that allows one to control the proximity of the inversions to regions that StyleGAN was originally trained on. We present an encoder based on our two principles that is specifically designed for facilitating editing on real images by balancing these tradeoffs. By evaluating its performance qualitatively and quantitatively on numerous challenging domains, including cars and horses, we show that our inversion method, followed by common editing techniques, achieves superior real-image editing quality, with only a small reconstruction accuracy drop.},

abstract="There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.",

abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are a powerful subclass of generative models. Despite a very rich research activity leading to numerous interesting GAN algorithms, it is still very hard to assess which algorithm(s) perform better than others. We conduct a neutral, multi-faceted large-scale empirical study on state-of-the art models and evaluation measures. We find that most models can reach similar scores with enough hyperparameter optimization and random restarts. This suggests that improvements can arise from a higher computational budget and tuning more than fundamental algorithmic changes. To overcome some limitations of the current metrics, we also propose several data sets on which precision and recall can be computed. Our experimental results suggest that future GAN research should be based on more systematic and objective evaluation procedures. Finally, we did not find evidence that any of the tested algorithms consistently outperforms the non-saturating GAN introduced in [9].},

abstract = {Computational experiments show that the greedy algorithm (GR) and the nearest neighbor algorithm (NN), popular choices for tour construction heuristics, work at acceptable level for the Euclidean TSP, but produce very poor results for the general Symmetric and Asymmetric TSP (STSP and ATSP). We prove that for every n⩾2 there is an instance of ATSP (STSP) on n vertices for which GR finds the worst tour. The same result holds for NN. We also analyze the repetitive NN (RNN) that starts NN from every vertex and chooses the best tour obtained. We prove that, for the ATSP, RNN always produces a tour, which is not worse than at least n/2−1 other tours, but for some instance it finds a tour, which is not worse than at most n−2 other tours, n⩾4. We also show that, for some instance of the STSP on n⩾4 vertices, RNN produces a tour not worse than at most 2n−3 tours. These results are in sharp contrast to earlier results by Gutin and Yeo, and Punnen and Kabadi, who proved that, for the ATSP, there are tour construction heuristics, including some popular ones, that always build a tour not worse than at least (n−2)! tours.}

abstract = {In 1878 Georg Cantor proved that unique, one-to-one mappings could be constructed between spaces of arbitrary yet different dimension. This paper is devoted to a detailed analysis of the earliest attempts to deal with the implications of that proof. Dedekind was the first to suggest that continuity was a key to the problem of dimensional invariance. Lüroth, Thomae, Jürgens and Netto offered solutions, Netto's being the most interesting in terms of the specifically topological character of his paper. Cantor finally offered a faulty proof in 1879 that domains of different dimension could not be mapped continuously onto each other by means of a one-to-one correspondence. Finally, consideration is given to the reasons why Netto's and Cantor's faulty proofs went unchallenged for twenty years, until Jürgens criticized them both in 1899.
Zusammenfassung
Im Jahre 1878 bewies Georg Cantor, dass einzig einein-deutige Abbildungen zwischen Räumen beliebiger, jedoch verschiedener Dimension hergestellt werden können. Die vorliegende Abhandlung ist einer detaillierten Analyse der frühesten Versuche gewidment, sich mit der Problematik jenes Beweises zu befassen. Zuerst wies Dedekind darauf hin, dass Kontinuität der Schlussel zu dem Problem der Dimensions-Invarianz sei. Lüroth, Thomae, Jürgens und Netto lieferten Lösungen; die interessanteste war die von Netto wegen des spezifisch topologischen Charakters seiner Abhandlung. Cantor schliesslich gab 1897 einen unvoll-kommenen Beweis, dass Gebiete verschiedener Dimension nicht kontinuierlich aufeinander mittels eineindeutiger Zuordnung abgebildet werden können. Den Schluss bildet eine Betrachtung über die Gründe, warum Nettos und Cantors unvollkommene Beweise 20 Jahre lang nicht in Frage gestellt wurden, bis Jürgens sie beide 1899 kritisierte.}

address = {Red Hook, NY, USA},
abstract = {We introduce a new generative model where samples are produced via Langevin dynamics using gradients of the data distribution estimated with score matching. Because gradients can be ill-defined and hard to estimate when the data resides on low-dimensional manifolds, we perturb the data with different levels of Gaussian noise, and jointly estimate the corresponding scores, i.e., the vector fields of gradients of the perturbed data distribution for all noise levels. For sampling, we propose an annealed Langevin dynamics where we use gradients corresponding to gradually decreasing noise levels as the sampling process gets closer to the data manifold. Our framework allows flexible model architectures, requires no sampling during training or the use of adversarial methods, and provides a learning objective that can be used for principled model comparisons. Our models produce samples comparable to GANs on MNIST, CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art inception score of 8.87 on CIFAR-10. Additionally, we demonstrate that our models learn effective representations via image inpainting experiments.},

In addition, we combine our method with gradient-based stochastic variational inference for latent stochastic differential equations. We use our method to fit stochastic dynamics defined by neural networks, achieving competitive performance ona 50-dimensional motion capture dataset.}
