  author={S{\"a}rkk{\"a}, Simo and Solin, Arno},
  abstract  = {The topic of this book is stochastic differential equations
               (SDEs). As their name suggests, they really are differential
               equations that produce a different ``answer'' or solution
               trajectory each time they are solved. This peculiar behaviour
               gives them properties that are useful in modeling of
               uncertainties in a wide range of applications, but at the same
               time it complicates the rigorous mathematical treatment of SDEs.
               The emphasis of the book is on applied rather than theoretical
               aspects of SDEs and, therefore, we have chosen to structure the
               book in a way that we believe supports learning SDEs from an
               applied point of view. In the following, we briefly outline the
               purposes of each of the remaining chapters and explain how the
               chapters are connected to each other. In the chapters, we have
               attempted to provide a wide selection of examples of the
               practical application of theoretical and methodological results.
               Each chapter (except for the Introduction and Epilogue) also
               contains a representative set of analytic and hands-on exercises
               that can be used for testing and deepening understanding of the
               topics. Chapter 2 is a brief outline of concepts and solutions
               methods for deterministic ordinary differential equations
               (ODEs). We especially emphasize solution methods for linear
               ODEs, because the methods translate quite easily to SDEs. We
               also examine commonly used numerical methods such as the Euler
               method and Runge--Kutta methods, which we extend to SDEs in the
               later chapters. Chapter 3 starts with a number of motivating
               examples of SDEs found in physics, engineering, finance, and
               other applications. It turns out that in a modeling sense, SDEs
               can be regarded as noise-driven ODEs, but this notion should not
               be taken too far. The aim of the rest of the chapter is to show
               where things start to go wrong. Roughly speaking, with linear
               SDEs we are quite safe with this kind of thinking, but anything
               beyond them will not work.},

abstract="As shown in Sects. 3.1, 2 we can immediately obtain expectation values for processes described by the linear Langevin equations (3.1, 31). For nonlinear Langevin equations (3.67, 110) expectation values are much more difficult to obtain, so here we first try to derive an equation for the distribution function. As mentioned already in the introduction, a differential equation for the distribution function describing Brownian motion was first derived by Fokker [1.1] and Planck [1.2]: many review articles and books on the Fokker-Planck equation now exist [1.5 -- 15].",
